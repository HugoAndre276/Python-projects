# cadeau_manon.py
A data analyser I use to get data from Discord (using CSV) and Messenger (using JSON) from conversations I've had with my girlfriend. Returns a .xlsx file. Names are hard-coded but can easily be changed while changing the data files.

# Fourier
A frequency analyser taking an Audacity screenshot and time boundaries as input and displaying a frequency spectrum with matplotlib and Fourier analysis.

# Simulation gravit√©
Different versions of a 2D gravity renderer between 2 corpses using newtonian physics displayed with matplotlib. 1.0 contains an object with infinite mass (orange) and an object (red) orbiting around it. 2.0 contains 2 objects with mass but they cannot collide. 3.0 adds radii and collisions.
